# Installation

## Requirements
Before installing **Grinder-PHP-Minify**, you need to make sure you have the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/tools/sdk)
and [Pub](https://dart.dev/tools/pub), the Dart package manager, up and running.

You can verify if you're already good to go with the following commands:

```shell
dart --version
# Dart SDK version: 2.10.4 (stable) (Wed Nov 11 13:35:58 2020 +0100) on "windows_x64"
```

?> If you plan to play with the package sources, you will also need [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell).

## Installing with Pub package manager

### 1. Depend on it
Add this to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
	grinder_php_minify: *
```

### 2. Install it
Install this package and its dependencies from a command prompt:

```shell
dart pub get
```

### 3. Import it
Now in your [Dart](https://dart.dev) code, you can use:

```dart
import "package:grinder_php_minify/grinder_php_minify.dart";
```
